		<p>My name is Victor and I work with ceramics and wood to make unique pottery vessels and crafted branch 
		flutes. My ceramics tend toward the ornate being hand-built, both detailed and methodical but with 
		dissymmetry breaking with the notion of perfection in their design. My flutes are entire tree branches 
		from various hardwoods, hollowed out, carved and tuned in the Native American style fLute.</p>
		
		<p>I'm not trained in any arts, having taken the rather roundabout route of studying astrophysics. 
		What was originally an approach to my artistic practice with a sense of helplessness (how do I do this?), has
		matured to a sense of being unconstrained in my approach to scuplting unique objects. Perhaps it is the
		physicist in me that seeks to observe the chaos of nature around us and accept the lent imprint of that
		in my own creation.</p>

		<p>I've worked in the field of education for the past 3 years. My experience has been informed
		on the basis of understanding the nature of physical reality and communicating with others to transmit
		knowledge. I'm also an experienced data scientist with varied skills in the digital sphere. Like the 
		website? &mdash; I coded it up from scratch myself!</p>
