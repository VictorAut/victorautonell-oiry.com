This is my website, dedicated to my crafts including ceramics and flutes.

The entirety of the website is built by myself and uses HTML, CSS and all logic in Javascript.

Features of particular interest:
- Javascript is used effectively (although with some redundancies in code) to open gallery images as modals
that can that showcase more pictures of the same ceramics/flute.

Areas of future development
- Include a database as opposed to hard-coding the upload of images. This is an intensive task and the result
is a slow loading time (it loads up ~50 images in one go)
- Code the database up in SQL
- Use a more scalable web framework (Laravel, Django etc.)
- Link my data science project contained in the "Understanding-Ceramics-Shop" repository to 'predict' the prices
of my pots.
